# MIPS-processor-simulator
Built a MIPS processor simulator in C as part of the 2nd-year course Introduction to Computer Systems.

mipssim.c is the implementation of a MIPS multi-cycle processor in C
memory_hierarchy.c is the implementation of a cache in C

Coursework 2 of the course was to implement the MIPS multi-cycle processor in C in mipssim.c. I scored a 100%.
Coursework 3 of the course was to extend the simulator from Coursework 2 for a 5-stage multi-cycle MIPS processor with three different cache models. A direct-mapped cache (aka  1-way set associative cache), a fully-associative cache, and a  2-way set-associative cache. I scored a 100% on this coursework too.

A skeleton code was provided.
